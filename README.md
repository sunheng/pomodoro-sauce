# pomodoro-sauce
Pomodoro-sauce, a saucy version of the time management technique by Francesco Cirillo.

##Description
Pomodoro-sauce is a spin-off of the Pomodoro Technique. The difference between the traditional and this version is the ability to keep track of the time spent after passing the focus or break state.

I find myself always passing my intended focus time, so this allows me to keep track of the overtime.
